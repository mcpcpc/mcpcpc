### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [kirc](https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc), a tiny IRC client written in POSIX C99.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning _the "ins and outs" of the C programming language_.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with _packaging kirc for other platforms_.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about _anything_!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Freenode `#kisslinux` or `#kirc` channels.
